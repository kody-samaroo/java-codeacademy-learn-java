CONDITIONALS AND CONTROL FLOW
If-Then Statement
The if-then statement is the most simple control flow we can write. It tests an expression for truth and executes some code based on it.
```
if (flip == 1) {
 
  System.out.println("Heads!");
 
}
```
The if keyword marks the beginning of the conditional statement, followed by parentheses ().
The parentheses hold a boolean datatype.
For the condition in parentheses we can also use variables that reference a boolean, or comparisons that evaluate to a boolean.

The boolean condition is followed by opening and closing curly braces that mark a block of code. This block runs if, and only if, the boolean is true.
```
boolean isValidPassword = true;
 
if (isValidPassword) {
 
  System.out.println("Password accepted!");
 
}
 
// Prints "Password accepted!"
 
int numberOfItemsInCart = 9;
 
if (numberOfItemsInCart > 12) {
 
  System.out.println("Express checkout not available");
 
}

// Nothing is printed.
```

If a conditional is brief we can omit the curly braces entirely:

if (true) System.out.println("Brevity is the soul of wit");
Note: Conditional statements do not end in a semicolon.

#### Instructions

1. The code editor contains an Order class to track retail shipments.

    Write an if-then statement that prints High value item! when itemCost is greater than 24.00.
